Vim and Neovim editors are so popular and loved by software developers and text writers from all over the world, so am I. During the Vim's development lead by [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar), there's always a trend that users want to make Vim an IDE, by providing all kinds of plugins: file explorer, UI widgets and icons, code completion, diagnostics, formatters, integrations with third-party command utils, etc. Even though Vim uses [vimscript](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script>) as its first-class citizen, it's still somehow a minority and discourage people to create their plugins or contribute to Vim project itself, maybe it's also related to the documentation and grammar design. The confliction between Vim's extensibility and user's requirements is growing.

Then Neovim came along in [2014](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Neovim>), with the goal of providing more friendly functionalities for developers and closer to the IDE editing experiences, by introducing [lua](https://www.lua.org/) as its scripting language and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) as the scripts runtime. This is quite controversial at the beginning since lua is somehow not very popular and successful, unlike [python](https://www.python.org/) or [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)/[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (on a runtime such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)). Before Neovim and lua, Vim community usually leverage these external languages for complex plugins such as code-completion, file explorer, etc. But the overhead is the [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) across the editor instance and language interpreter/runtime process.

Turns out Neovim's choice is successful, luajit improves the performance a lot, and lua provides a much better grammar (compares with vimscript) that helps user handle more code logic. It encourages more user to create their own plugins and provide more features. The scripting language [plays the most important role in (Neo)Vim editor, it also turns the editor into a script interpreter/runtime/virtual machine](https://github.com/rsvim/rfc/blob/873cf96ca2ea256c0694e9396816b2ded827d08a/2-JavascriptEngine.md?plain=1#L9). This is why when I look at the (Neo)Vim editor, the idea to reinvent the Vim editor with Rust+Typescript suddenly popped up.

Compares with C/C++, Rust provides much more powerful language features, toolchains and community libraries/frameworks. And Javascript engines such as [V8](https://v8.dev/), [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) also provide great solutions to allow us embed javascript into a command line.
