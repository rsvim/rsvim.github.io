# Install Plugin

A plugin is actually the same thing as those multi-files configuration, simple package or npm package we mentioned before, a single javascript/typescript file can be a plugin, a package can be a plugin as well. Difference is the concepts: "configuration" is how your editor should behave, while "plugin" is how these configurations are shared and distributed among the community and users.
