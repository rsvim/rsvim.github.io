# Plugin

A plugin is actually the same thing as those [multi-files configuration, simple package or npm package](docs/manual/configuration) we mentioned in last section, a single javascript/typescript file can be a plugin, a package can be a plugin as well.

Difference is the concepts: "configuration" is how you configure your editor, "plugin" is how the configurations are shared around the community.
