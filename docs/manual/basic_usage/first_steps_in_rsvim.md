# First Steps in Rsvim

To start Rsvim, open terminal and enter this command:

```bash
rsvim file.txt
```

Rsvim starts editing a file called "file.txt", because this is a new file, you get a blank window. The terminal will look like:

![Img1](./assets/first_steps_in_rsvim1.svg)

('#' is the cursor position.)
