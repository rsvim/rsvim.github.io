# Get Started

Based on the strong concept of introducing capabilities similar to UI frameworks and leveraging modern [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language and their thriving community, RSVIM is completely developed from scratch with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) as an async runtime for event loop and [Rusty V8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) provided by [Deno team](https://deno.com/).

RSVIM is still the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)/[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor, it behaves almost the same, while multiple sub-components are redesigned/reinvented. 100% perfect compatible with existing Vim community in [Vimscript (or VimL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript), Neovim community in [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) is unavoidable and unrealistic, and break changes are expected. Which is believed to be the necessary price for its rebirth.

This document introduces manuals for RSVIM, you can contribute to this document on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsvim/rsvim.github.io).
