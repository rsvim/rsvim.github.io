Rsvim is the Vim editor reinvented in Rust+TypeScript. It follows main features, concepts and philosophy of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), but all components are built from scratch and redesigned with a modern development approach, rather than simply copy-paste. It is developed with rust, tokio and V8 javascript engine.

While it is completely developed from scratch, multiple sub-components are redesigned/reinvented. 100% perfect compatible with existing [Vimscript (or VimL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript) community (for Vim), [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) community (for Neovim) is unrealistic, break changes are expected and unavoidable.

This chapter introduces the manuals for Rsvim.
