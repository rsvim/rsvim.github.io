Rsvim is the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor reinvented in Rust+TypeScript, it (should) behaves almost the same, inherits their philosophy and shares most concepts among them. While it is completely developed from scratch, with multiple sub-components been redesigned/reinvented, 100% perfect compatible with existing Vim community in [Vimscript (or VimL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) community in [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) is unrealistic, break changes are expected and unavoidable.

This chapter introduces the manuals for Rsvim.
