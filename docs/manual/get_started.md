Rsvim is the Vim editor reinvented in Rust+TypeScript, it behaves almost the same with [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), inherits most of the philosophy and concepts from them.

While it is completely developed from scratch, multiple sub-components are redesigned/reinvented. 100% perfect compatible with existing [Vimscript (or VimL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript) community (for Vim), [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) community (for Neovim) is unrealistic, break changes are expected and unavoidable.

This chapter introduces the manuals for Rsvim.
